                    It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is
                    directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).
                    As a "pure" container, the element does not inherently represent anything. Instead, it's used to
                    group content so it can be easily styled using the class or id attributes, marking a section of a
                    document as being written in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on.
